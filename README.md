# PLP_Project
My project will be on a web application meant to assist first year students moving to universisties in new cities to be able to find local eateries ( Vibandas ). 
It's a new environment and before one starts to get a good lay of the land this web app will prove useful.
The web app will utilize google maps and also showcase the different meals offered and their different pricing to give the user total control over the choice to be made.
