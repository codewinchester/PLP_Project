# PLP_Project
My project will be on a web application meant to assist first year students moving to universisties in new cities to be able to find local eateries ( Vibandas ). The web app will utilize google maps and also showcase the different meals offered and their different pricing to give the user total control over the choice to be made. 
This can also help the user get well onboarded to the new environment.
